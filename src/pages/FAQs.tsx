      category: 'Income Tax',
      question: 'What are the benefits of new tax regime vs old tax regime?',
      answer: 'New Tax Regime: Lower tax rates but no exemptions/deductions except few. Old Tax Regime: Higher tax rates but allows deductions under 80C, 80D, HRA, etc. Choose based on your deduction amount. Generally, new regime benefits those with minimal deductions, while old regime suits those with significant deductions. You can switch annually (salaried) or once (business income).'
